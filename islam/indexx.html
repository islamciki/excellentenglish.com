           <p>Here, I had a presentation about my English school. We discussed the courses offered, the teaching methods, and the qualifications of the teachers. I also shared my personal experience as a student and the progress I have made in my English language skills. Overall, it was a great opportunity to showcase the benefits of attending this school and to encourage others to consider it for their own language learning journey.

            ELTS (International English Language Testing System) and TOEFL (Test of English as a Foreign Language) are two widely recognized English language proficiency tests. These tests are commonly used by universities, colleges, and employers around the world to assess the English language skills of non-native speakers.

            IELTS:
            
            IELTS is jointly owned by the British Council, IDP: IELTS Australia, and Cambridge Assessment English.
            The test measures the four language skills: listening, reading, writing, and speaking.
            There are two types of IELTS tests: Academic and General Training.
            Academic IELTS is typically required for higher education or professional registration, while General Training IELTS is typically required for immigration purposes.
            The test takes approximately 2 hours and 45 minutes to complete.
            The speaking section of the test is conducted face-to-face with a trained examiner, while the other sections are done on a computer or on paper.
            TOEFL:
            
            TOEFL is owned by the Educational Testing Service (ETS).
            The test measures the four language skills: reading, listening, speaking, and writing.
            The test is primarily used for academic purposes, such as admission to universities and colleges in English-speaking countries.
            The test takes approximately 3 hours to complete.
            The speaking section of the test is conducted via computer, while the other sections are also done on a computer.
            Both IELTS and TOEFL are standardized tests, meaning that they have a set format and are scored according to a predetermined rubric. Scores for both tests are valid for two years. Ultimately, the choice between the two tests depends on the requirements of the institution or organization where the test taker is applying.
